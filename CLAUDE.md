# CLAUDE.md

## Working Style
- Research before editing. Never change code you haven't read.
- `npm run smoke` before claiming anything is done — unit tests miss the minifier / concurrent-render / event-contract classes of bug.
- **When you discover something non-obvious, append to `LEARNINGS.md` before moving on.** One dated entry, 3 bullets (what bit you, why, how it's avoided now). This is how sessions and subagents stay in sync — the SessionStart hook surfaces the most recent entries automatically. Durable patterns graduate from LEARNINGS.md into this file's Gotchas section during cleanup passes.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev           # Vite dev server with SPA-fallback middleware for React Router
npm run build         # Production build → dist-deploy/ (uses vite.deploy.config.js)
npm test              # Vitest watch mode
npm run test:run      # Vitest single run (63 tests)
npm run smoke         # Build + serve dist-deploy + run Playwright canary (19 checks)
npm run smoke:headed  # Same, but with a visible browser window
npm run lint          # ESLint flat config — fails on errors, allows warnings
npm run lint:fix      # ESLint with --fix
npm run format        # Prettier write
npm run format:check  # Prettier verify only
```

A pre-push hook (`.husky/pre-push`) runs lint + `test:run` automatically. CI
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) adds the smoke check on every PR. Bypass
with `git push --no-verify` in an emergency.

## Architecture

Single editor route, pill-based UI, shared scene/atoms/hooks. The legacy sidebar editor was retired in Phase 1.2 of the Vedute roadmap (vedute-rebrand branch).

- **`/app` (the only editor)** — pill-based UI. Floating glass pills around a full-bleed canvas; an aspect-ratio frame overlay shows the poster crop. Lives in `src/pages/mock/`. (The folder name is historical from when this was a prototype variant alongside the now-deleted sidebar editor — don't read into it.)
- **`/app-classic`** → React Router redirect to `/app` (kept so legacy bookmarks resolve).
- **`/mock`** → React Router redirect to `/app`.
- **`/dof-lab`** — DoF prototype variant, still mounted but secondary.

The editor was migrated from the standalone HTML prototype at `prototypes/poster-v3-ui.{html,jsx}` — that prototype still builds and routes (via `vercel.json`), kept as a reference implementation. Changes go into the React tree; the prototype is intentionally frozen.

**State pattern.** Jotai atoms are the UI source of truth. `Scene.jsx`'s `useFrame` reads from `sceneRef` (a mutable mirror of atom values), NOT the atoms directly — React render rate is too slow for 60fps reads. `useSceneRefSync` at the top of Scene keeps the mirror in lockstep with atoms.

**Event channels between UI and Scene** (all on `window`):
- `camera-set` — UI slider → Scene moves camera
- `fly-to` — location search / preset view click → Scene tweens camera
- `fov-change` — focal length slider → Controls.jsx dolly-zooms
- `get-camera` — save-view / session save → Scene responds via `detail.resolve(cam)`
- `restore-view` — saved-view click OR session restore → Scene applies camera
- `save-view`, `load-view`, `delete-view`, `rename-view`, `reorder-view` — saved-view mgmt
- `set-default-view` — `{id}` or `{id: null}` to mark/unmark default
- `gallery-add`, `gallery-remove`, `gallery-toggle-public` — gallery mgmt
- `queue-retry`, `queue-remove`, `queue-reorder`, `queue-clear-{done,all}` — render queue
- `toast` — `{type: 'success'|'error'|'info', message}` rendered by ToastHost
- `save-session` — forces immediate persist
- `aspect-changed`, `location-changed`, `open-*` for modals

When adding a new event: **test both sides of the contract in `__tests__/integration/event-contracts.test.js`**. Half the regressions this session were shape mismatches.

## Gotchas (things that actually broke in the last session)

1. **Never put a per-frame atom in a debounced effect's deps.** `cameraReadoutAtom` updates at 5Hz from Scene's useFrame. Having it in `useSessionPersistence`'s save-deps starved the 500ms debounce — save never fired. Atoms that change faster than the debounce don't belong as deps.

2. **Camera position lives outside atoms.** `registerCamera(camera)` in Scene's `useLayoutEffect` exposes the Three.js camera to the session-persistence hook. Without that call, only tilt/heading/altitude get saved — on restore the camera snaps back to the Empire State default.

3. **fov is VERTICAL.** three.js `camera.fov` is vertical degrees. Formula: `2 * atan(12 / mm)` (24mm full-frame sensor height). NOT `2 * atan(36 / (2*mm))` (horizontal). Two listeners using different formulas compound every slider tick and send the camera to space.

4. **CSS minifier strips vendor prefixes.** Rolldown's default CSS minifier deduplicated `backdrop-filter` / `-webkit-backdrop-filter` and kept only the prefixed form — Chrome/Firefox don't read that, so the sidebar glass disappeared only in prod. Fix in `vite.deploy.config.js`: `cssMinify: 'esbuild'`.

5. **Don't wrap `#sidebar` + `#main` in an opaque container.** The sidebar's `backdrop-filter` blurs what's painted behind it; if an ancestor fills its region with a solid background, there's nothing meaningful to blur. `.editor-root` is a transparent flex pass-through; keep it that way.

6. **React 19 concurrent rendering can drop during-render ref writes.** `latest.current = {…}` in the function body was silently dropped under the prod build. Update refs in `useEffect`, not render.

7. **Build + prod paths differ.** Vite dev serves raw CSS/JS; prod minifies + tree-shakes. `npm run smoke` drives the actual prod bundle through a headless browser and catches all of the above.

## Testing

- `src/pages/editor/__tests__/*.test.js` — unit tests with Vitest + jsdom
- `src/pages/editor/__tests__/integration/*.test.js` — cross-boundary tests (event contracts, save/restore shapes)
- `scripts/smoke.js` — headless Chromium against the built artifact

## Deployment

Vercel auto-deploys on push to `main`. Rewrites in `vercel.json`:
- `/` → `/prototypes/index.html` (landing is the prototype page, not React)
- `/app`, `/app/*` → `/src/index.html` (pill editor)
- `/app-classic`, `/app-classic/*` → `/src/index.html` (sidebar editor)
- `/mock`, `/mock/*` → `/src/index.html` (React redirects to /app)
- `/*.html` → their matching prototype pages

React routes like `/login`, `/signup`, `/community`, `/profile`, `/gallery` are NOT rewritten in `vercel.json`. They work in dev via the SPA-fallback middleware in `vite.config.js` but deep-linking them in prod will 404. Add them to `vercel.json` if needed.
